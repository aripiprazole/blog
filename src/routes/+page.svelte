    My name is Gabrielle and I am a 17-year-old software engineer with a passion
    for functional programming and the Kotlin programming language. In my free
    time, I enjoy playing Minecraft and working on projects related to
    compilers. I am excited to share my skills and experience with others in the
    field.

    <h2>My projects üß™</h2>
    <p>
      I'm passionate about compilers, type theory, the Minecraft protocol, and
      Hindley Milner! These topics perfectly blend my love for programming and
      problem-solving. Compilers transform code into machine code, while Hindley
      Milner adds elegance and safety to the process. Tinkering with the
      Minecraft protocol to optimize and customize gameplay is a joy. I love
      pushing the boundaries of programming and seeking new challenges!
